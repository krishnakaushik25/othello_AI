**Turn-based game AI using adverserial search** 

Select a two player turn based game.
Two suggested games are Othello or Checkers. 

- Describe how playing the game can be formulated as an adverserial search problem 
-  Implement move generators and evaluation functions 
-  Construct a game playing agent based on alpha-beta search 
-  Compare the effect of increasing search depth, improving move ordering, and improving the evaluation function.
-  Implement a graphical user interface for playing the game against an AI opponent.
It does not need to be fancy and could just display the board, then ask for input, and then redraw the board so that you can implement it in Python
